# CrowdFunding ETL

For the ETL mini project, you will work with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transform the data, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, you’ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

Since this is a one-week project, make sure that you have done at least half of your project before the third day of class to stay on track.

Although you and your partner will divide the work, it’s essential to collaborate and communicate while working on different parts of the project. Be sure to check in with your partner regularly and offer support.

# Skills Demonstrated:

-Worked off on Jupyter Notebook and using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data.

-Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames

-Create the Campaign DataFrame

-Create the Contacts DataFrame

-Create the Crowdfunding Database using pgAdmin software.

-Created Database Schema and ERD and imported the CSV file to the tables created in Schema.

# Verifying Databases
-To verify and test if the schema works:

	-Please create a new Postgres database, named crowdfunding_db.

	-With the provided file "Crowdfunding_db_schemas.sql" copy and paste it to Postgres.

	-it will create the DataFrames listed in the schemas.

	-Import the CSV files in Resources folder into each Dataframe/table that was created. 

	-CSV files has to be imported by the following order: contacts, category, subcategory and campaign. 
	
	

# Resources

We used in-class activities, Xpert Learning Assistant, StackOverFlow and Quickdatabasediagrams. We used time in and out of class to complete this project. 

We divided the work and use checkpoints to discuss and make changes as needed to complete to project.
